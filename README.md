# Codewars Kata Solutions

[![CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/ecaCosca/badges/large)](https://www.codewars.com/users/ecaCosca)

Here's my solution to all the Katas I've done thus far in Codewars, trying to walk the path of the code ninja.

This is just ONE way to solve the kata, not the ONLY way, I just want to be able to share them and compare 
if I can throught the process of teaching and learning by doing.

All of them are in JavaScript.
